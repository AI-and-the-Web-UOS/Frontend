# Search Frontend Server
## Project for AI and the Web
This is a simple Flask application that provides two endpoints, one to display an html template that allows the user to enter a search term and the other to display an html template that displays the results of the search. This frontend server communicates with the backend server via a REST API. This project was part of the course "AI and the Web" at Osnabrück University.

## ❓ Why?
To distribute the load of handeling user requests and doing the actual rankings of websites, we decided to split the search process in different application. On the one hand, there is the application which has been implemented in this repo that handles incoming requests and calculates the vectors. On the other hand, there is an application, which loads the existing website data from a MongoDB database and matches the entries in this database with the user query, to return optimal results. Lastly there is the web crawler that updates the search index database.

## 🚫 Limitations
Efficiently managing server loads is a critical aspect of web service optimization. One approach to achieve better load management is to assign specific clusters of websites to individual servers. By leveraging unsupervised clustering techniques on the vector representations of websites stored in the database, we can group similar websites together. Each server would then be responsible for serving requests related to websites within its designated cluster. This strategy ensures that servers are specialized in handling a specific subset of websites, minimizing the risk of overloading and optimizing resource utilization. Additionally, it enhances response times for users as they are directed to servers tailored to their search context. Such an approach not only improves server load management but also enhances the overall performance and scalability of the web service. But due to the scope of the project, this feature was not implemented.
